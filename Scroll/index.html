        <div class="text"><p>Hornet is the mysterious princess-protector of Hallownest’s ruins, a major character in Hollow Knight and the 
            protagonist of Hollow Knight: Silksong. She wields a needle and thread with deadly prowess. As a boss, 
            Hornet appears in two forms, Hornet Protector in Greenpath and Hornet Sentinel in Kingdom's Edge. She must be 
            defeated twice to unlock her Journal entry, but this can be either by defeating both forms or by defeating her 
            Protector form once in Greenpath and once in Godmaster Icon.png Godhome.</p>
            <p>Hornet is the daughter of the Pale King and Herrah the Beast, the queen of Deepnest. Her birth was the result of a bargain for her 
            mother to become a Dreamer, and as such, she spent only a short time with Herrah. Her shared father with the Knight and the rest 
            of the Vessels makes them siblings.</p>
            <p>Raised in Deepnest, Hornet survived the Infection and the fall of the kingdom. She wanders its ruins, chasing off travellers who would seek 
            to desecrate them, but also protecting the sealing of the Black Egg. She also guards the Cast-Off Shell in the Kingdom's Edge which can grant the 
            King's Brand, the key to the Abyss. In her duties, she encountered Quirrel in the Howling Cliffs at his arrival in Hallownest. She attempted to 
            fight him but was repelled by the mask of Monomon he wears on his head. Hornet leaves him be after recognizing the mask, knowing that he was called 
            upon, despite him not knowing it.</p>
            <p>Like Quirrel and the Knight, she sensed the awakening of the Infection and started wandering Hallownest in search of answers. In Hollow Knight, 
            she works to stop the impending doom looming on Hallownest. In Hollow Knight: Silksong, she ends up captured and brought to the haunted kingdom 
            of Pharloom.</p>

    <section class="sessao" id="sessao_dois">
        <div class="text"><p>Before the fall of Hallownest, Quirrel used to be Monomon’s apprentice. When Monomon became a Dreamer, 
            she entrusted Quirrel with her mask, which was part of an additional protection enacted upon herself. Quirrel can be seen 
            wearing this mask on top of his head.</p>
            <p>In the official comic, it is shown that Quirrel ended up outside of Hallownest, causing him to lose much of his memory. 
                He was called back to Hallownest by Monomon in order to reverse the protection placed on her. He had dreams of 
                Hallownest; the City of Tears, Fog Canyon, the Forgotten Crossroads, the Temple of the Black Egg, and the Hollow Knight. 
                After entering the Howling Cliffs, Quirrel meets Hornet, whom he briefly fights. Hornet allows Quirrel to enter Hallownest 
                when she recognizes Monomon’s mask.</p>
            <p>Quirrel can initially be found at the Temple of the Black Egg, but he can be encountered in several locations around 
                Hallownest. After helping the Knight kill Monomon by removing the protection on her, he goes to the Blue Lake to see the 
                source of the rain in the City of Tears.</p>

        <div class="text" id="text_grimm"><p>Grimm é o lider da Trupe Grimm, da DLC The Grimm Troupe, um misterioso circo itinerante.</p>
            <p>Grimm e sua trupe viajam do reino do pesadelo para onde quer que a lanterna do pesadelo tenha sido acesa por acólitos. 
                Eles juntam Chamas do Pesadelo de terras arruinadas para alimentar o sinistro ser escravizador da Trupe, o Coração do 
                Pesadelo.</p>
            <p>Grimm e sua trupe montaram tendas em Dirtmouth assim que o Cavaleiro acendeu a sua lanterna em Penhascos Uivantes. 
                Dentro do edifício principal, ele aparece para o Cavaleiro em um show de luz vermelha e fumaça. O Mestre da Trupe 
                está ciente de que o Cavaleiro os chamou com a lanterna dele e os oferece para participar de seu ritual. Ele então 
                lhe dá um amuleto chamado Criança Grimm e o confia para coletar as chamas do Pesadelo reunidas por seus Grimmkins em 
                todo o Hallownest.</p>
            <p>Com cada conjunto de três chamas reunidas, Grimm faz com que a Criança Grimm os consumam para crescer. Após a segunda 
                missão, o Grimm testa a força do Cavaleiro em uma batalha teatral ardente. Em preparação para o confronto com o Rei do 
                Pesadelo ao completar mais três chamas, ele estará em um quarto secreto no circo, dormindo. Ele também o recompensa com 
                um entalhe do amuleto Criança Grimm.</p>
